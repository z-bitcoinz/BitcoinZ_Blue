# 🔧 Fix for "Damaged App" Issue

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The app was still showing as "damaged" because:
1. Ad-hoc signing was being applied AFTER the ZIP file was created
2. The ZIP contained an unsigned app bundle
3. electron-builder wasn't properly configured to sign during build

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**
- Modified to use electron-builder's native signing capabilities
- Added `CODESIGN_IDENTITY: "-"` environment variable
- Ensured signing happens BEFORE packaging into ZIP

### 2. **Enhanced afterSignHook.js**
- Now properly verifies and applies ad-hoc signatures
- Checks if app is already signed before attempting to sign
- Removes quarantine attributes during build process

### 3. **Key Changes Made**
```yaml
# In build-and-sign.yml
env:
  CODESIGN_IDENTITY: "-"  # Forces ad-hoc signing
  
# Build command now uses:
npx electron-builder -m -c.mac.identity=null -c.mac.type=distribution
```

## 🚀 Testing the Fix

The fix has been pushed. To verify it works:

1. **Monitor the new build** at: https://github.com/z-bitcoinz/BitcoinZ_Blue/actions
2. **Download the macOS artifact** once build completes
3. **Extract and test** - should NOT show "damaged" error

## 📋 What to Expect

### Before Fix:
- ❌ "BitcoinZ Blue is damaged and can't be opened"
- App bundle inside ZIP was unsigned

### After Fix:
- ✅ "BitcoinZ Blue can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"
- App bundle is properly ad-hoc signed BEFORE packaging
- Simple right-click → Open works

## 🔍 Verification Steps

1. Download the new build artifact
2. Extract the ZIP
3. Run in Terminal:
   ```bash
   codesign -dv "BitcoinZ Blue.app"
   ```
   Should show: `Signature=adhoc`

4. Right-click → Open should work without "damaged" error

## 💡 Key Insight

The critical issue was timing - signing must happen:
1. After electron-builder creates the app bundle
2. BEFORE electron-builder creates the ZIP archive

This is now properly handled by the afterSignHook.js and the updated build process.
