Hi Rok,

I need your help with Apple Developer access for the BitcoinZ Blue wallet project. We need to properly sign the macOS builds to avoid security warnings for users.

Could you help with ONE of these options?

**OPTION 1: Add me to your Apple Developer team (Best for ongoing work)**
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Click "People" â†’ "Invite People"
3. Add my email: [YOUR EMAIL HERE]
4. Give me "Admin" or "App Manager" role (so I can create certificates)
5. I'll accept the invitation and handle the rest

**OPTION 2: Create a Developer ID certificate (Quick solution)**
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Click "Certificates, IDs & Profiles"
3. Click "+" to create new certificate
4. Choose "Developer ID Application" (NOT Mac App Store)
5. Follow the steps to create the certificate
6. Download and install it in Keychain Access
7. Export as .p12 file with a password
8. Send me:
   - The .p12 certificate file
   - The password for the .p12
   - Your Team ID (found in Membership section)
   - Your Apple ID email

**Why we need this:**
- Users get "unidentified developer" warnings without proper signing
- macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps
- Notarization requires Developer ID certificate
- Professional distribution for BitcoinZ Blue

The certificate lasts 5 years and allows unlimited app signing. Once set up, all BitcoinZ Blue releases will be properly signed and notarized.

Let me know which option works better for you. Option 2 takes about 10 minutes if you're in a hurry.

Thanks!
Simon

P.S. I already set up all the GitHub Actions workflows for automatic signing - just need the certificate to make it work.
