Hi Rok,

Thanks for inviting me to App Store Connect! I accepted the invitation.

I'm working on the BitcoinZ Blue wallet and need to set up code signing for macOS. Could you help me with one of these options:

OPTION 1 (Easiest - 5 minutes):
Could you quickly create a Developer ID certificate and share it with me?
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Click "Certificates, IDs & Profiles" → Certificates → "+"
3. Choose "Developer ID Application" 
4. Create and download the certificate
5. Export from Keychain as .p12 with a password
6. Send me:
   - The .p12 file
   - The password
   - Your Team ID (found in Membership section)
   - Your Apple ID email

OPTION 2 (Better long-term):
Add me to the Apple Developer Program team:
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Click "People"
3. Invite me with "Admin" or "App Manager" role
4. I'll handle the rest

Either option works! Option 1 is quicker if you're busy.

Thanks!
Simon
