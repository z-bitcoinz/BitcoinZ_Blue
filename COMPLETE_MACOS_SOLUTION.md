```

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Solutions

### 1. Free Workarounds

#### A. Distribute via Homebrew
```ruby
# homebrew-cask formula
cask "bitcoinz-blue" do
  version "1.0.6"
  sha256 "YOUR_SHA256_HERE"
  
  url "https://github.com/z-bitcoinz/BitcoinZ_Blue/releases/download/v#{version}/BitcoinZ-Blue-#{version}-arm64.dmg"
  name "BitcoinZ Blue"
  desc "Lightweight wallet for BitcoinZ"
  
  app "BitcoinZ Blue.app"
end
```

#### B. Direct App Distribution
Instead of DMG, distribute the .app directly in a ZIP:
```bash
# Create a ZIP that preserves extended attributes
cd dist/mac-arm64
zip -r -y "BitcoinZ-Blue-1.0.6-arm64-app.zip" "BitcoinZ Blue.app"
```

#### C. Use GitHub Releases
GitHub Releases adds some trust to downloads:
- Upload to official releases
- Include SHA256 checksums
- Sign with GPG keys

### 2. Proper Solution (Requires $99/year)

#### Apple Developer Program
1. Join Apple Developer Program
2. Get Developer ID certificate
3. Sign with Developer ID
4. Notarize the app
5. Staple the notarization
