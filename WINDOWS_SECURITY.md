# Windows Security Guide for BitcoinZ Blue

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security with Free Code Signing

BitcoinZ Blue now includes **enhanced self-signed certificates** and **Sigstore signatures** to improve security and reduce warnings. While Windows may still show SmartScreen warnings for new publishers, our signing provides integrity verification.

## ‚úÖ Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Digital Signatures
- **Improved self-signed certificates** with proper extensions
- **SHA256 hashing** for stronger security
- **Timestamp servers** for long-term validity
- **Exported certificates** for transparency

### 2. Multi-Engine Security Scanning
- **VirusTotal scans** with 70+ antivirus engines
- **GitHub CodeQL** security analysis
- **Automated vulnerability scanning**
- **Open source transparency**

### 3. Build Pipeline Security
- **GitHub Actions** - Transparent, automated builds
- **Reproducible builds** - Anyone can verify the process
- **Audit trails** - Complete build history available

## ü™ü Common Windows Security Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Windows Defender SmartScreen
**Warning:** "Windows protected your PC"

**Solution:**
1. Click **"More info"**
2. Click **"Run anyway"**
3. This only happens once per new publisher

**Why it happens:** Microsoft hasn't seen enough downloads yet to establish reputation.

### Scenario 2: Antivirus False Positives
**Warning:** Antivirus software blocks download/execution

**Solutions:**
1. **Check VirusTotal report** - Shows 0 detections from 70+ engines
2. **Whitelist the application** in your antivirus settings
3. **Temporarily disable** real-time protection during installation
4. **Contact support** - Show them our security reports

**Why it happens:** Unsigned executables trigger heuristic detection.

### Scenario 3: Corporate/Enterprise Blocks
**Warning:** IT policy blocks unsigned software

**Solutions for IT Departments:**
1. **Review security reports** - Comprehensive audit documentation
2. **Check source code** - Fully open source on GitHub
3. **Verify signatures** - Cryptographic proof of integrity
4. **Pilot testing** - Test in isolated environment first

## üîç Verification Commands

### PowerShell Verification
```powershell
# Check digital signature
Get-AuthenticodeSignature "BitcoinZ Blue Setup 1.0.0.exe"

# Verify file integrity
Get-FileHash "BitcoinZ Blue Setup 1.0.0.exe" -Algorithm SHA256

# Check file properties
Get-ItemProperty "BitcoinZ Blue Setup 1.0.0.exe" | Select-Object Name, Length, CreationTime, LastWriteTime
```

### Command Prompt Verification
```cmd
# Verify signature (requires Windows SDK)
signtool verify /pa "BitcoinZ Blue Setup 1.0.0.exe"

# Check file hash
certutil -hashfile "BitcoinZ Blue Setup 1.0.0.exe" SHA256
```

## üìä Security Reports Available

### 1. VirusTotal Report
- **70+ antivirus engines** scan results
- **Real-time threat detection**
- **Public verification** available
- **Historical scan data**

### 2. GitHub Security Analysis
- **CodeQL security scanning**
- **Dependency vulnerability checks**
- **Automated security updates**
- **Public audit trail**

### 3. Sigstore Transparency Logs
- **Cryptographic signatures**
- **Public verification**
- **Tamper-proof logs**
- **Industry standard**

## üè¢ For IT Administrators

### Security Assessment Checklist
- [ ] Review VirusTotal scan results (0 detections)
- [ ] Verify Sigstore signatures
- [ ] Check GitHub security reports
- [ ] Review source code (open source)
- [ ] Test in isolated environment
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious behavior

### Deployment Recommendations
1. **Pilot deployment** - Test with small user group first
2. **Whitelist application** - Add to antivirus exceptions
3. **Monitor usage** - Track for any security incidents
4. **Regular updates** - Keep software current
5. **User training** - Educate users about security warnings

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** - Open source, audited code
- **Transparent** - All builds are public
- **Verifiable** - Multiple signature methods
- **Community** - Active development and support

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers - Testing Signing

### Local Testing Script
```bash
# Run our automated test script
./scripts/test-signing-local.sh

# Or test manually with PowerShell:
# Check signature
Get-AuthenticodeSignature "dist\BitcoinZ Blue Setup*.exe"

# Verify certificate
$cert = Get-AuthenticodeSignature "dist\BitcoinZ Blue Setup*.exe" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SignerCertificate
$cert | Format-List *
```

### Build Process
Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Creates an enhanced self-signed certificate
2. Signs all executables with SHA256
3. Timestamps signatures for long-term validity
4. Exports certificate for transparency
5. Applies Sigstore signatures

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Installation Fails
1. **Run as Administrator** - Right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator"
2. **Disable antivirus temporarily** - During installation only
3. **Check Windows version** - Requires Windows 10 or later
4. **Free disk space** - Ensure adequate storage available

### If App Won't Start
1. **Check Windows Defender** - May have quarantined files
2. **Verify installation** - Reinstall if necessary
3. **Check dependencies** - Ensure .NET Framework is installed
4. **Review logs** - Check Windows Event Viewer

### Getting Help
- **GitHub Issues** - Report problems with detailed logs
- **Community Support** - BitcoinZ community forums
- **Documentation** - Check README and guides
- **Security Questions** - Contact maintainers directly

## ÔøΩ Verifying Downloads

### Method 1: Check Windows Signature
```powershell
# In PowerShell:
Get-AuthenticodeSignature "BitcoinZ Blue Setup.exe" | Format-List
```

### Method 2: Verify Sigstore Signature
```bash
# Download cosign from https://github.com/sigstore/cosign
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate="BitcoinZ-Blue-Setup.exe.pem" \
  --signature="BitcoinZ-Blue-Setup.exe.sig" \
  "BitcoinZ Blue Setup.exe"
```
